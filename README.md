# HexagonalDemo

API demonstrating hexagonal architecture. We utilized Hexagonal Architecture at my last job to separate business logic from lower-level implementation, and to reduce reuse of code.
Hexagonal is an interesting intersection between object-oriented programming and domain driven design. There's a real express server in this project so you can test it out and see
that the endpoints work, though the DB calls are mocked out. I used this to demonstrate our architecture pattern to the other engineering teams.
